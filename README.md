# X-Clone :dolphin:

Made using the python framework Flask, this is a frontend + backend clone of twitter. Of course, it does not have ALL the functionalities Twitter has, but it can do the functions that are quintescential to Twitter, namely:

1. Login and logout functionalities.
2. Creating own account.
3. Home Page
4. Profile Page
5. Tweet/Post page

## Screenshots

Have tried to keep the UI as similiar as that of Twitter. Is not mobile responsive yet so is better to view it in landscape on laptop or desktop. The reason this hasn't been done yet is that this project's primary purpose was not to create a fronend site but rather create a fully functional generic social media website
