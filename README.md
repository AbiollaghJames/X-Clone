# X-Clone

Made using the python framework Flask, this is a frontend + backend clone of twitter. Of course, it does not have ALL the functionalities Twitter has, but it can do the functions that are quintescential to Twitter, namely:

1. Login and logout functionalities.
2. Creating own account.

## Screenshots

Have tried to keep the UI as similiar as that of Twitter. Is not mobile responsive yet so is better to view it in landscape on laptop or desktop. The reason this hasn't been done yet is that this project's primary purpose was not to create a fronend site but rather create a fully functional generic social media website



### To run on your machine

    1. Clone this repository to your local machine, create virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`
    2. Activate the virtual environment using - `source .venv/bin/activate`
    3. Make sure you have the right python version setup using Ubuntu. Install the dependencies using - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
    4. Start the server running @localhost:5000 using - `python3 app.py`
    5. To go back to terminal after running the above script, use `CTRL + C`
